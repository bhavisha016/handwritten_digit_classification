Handwritten Digit Classification Using Keras
This repository contains a mini-project to classify handwritten digits (0â€“9) using the MNIST dataset. The project demonstrates the use of deep learning techniques for image classification in a simple and beginner-friendly way.

ðŸŒŸ Overview
Handwritten digit classification is a classic problem in machine learning. The MNIST dataset, consisting of 28x28 grayscale images, is used to train and test a model that predicts the digit represented in each image.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
Source: The MNIST dataset is built into Keras and can be loaded using:
python
Copy code
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist  
Details:
60,000 training samples
10,000 testing samples
